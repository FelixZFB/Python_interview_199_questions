Nowadays mobile phones are becoming more and more popular among the middle school students. In my opinion, we can bring mobile phones to school.
As we know, the 21st century is a modern age and full of information. A mobile phone is one of the quickest tools for us to exchange information. The mobile phone is a fashionable and useful invention, so we ought to make the best use of it. Suppose there's a sudden accident, it is more convenient for us to dial for help immediately. There're also some games in the mobile phone. We can relax ourselves by playing them when we're tired of our studies. In my opinion, it's not wrong to follow the fashion, but the most important thing is how to use the mobile phone in a right way.


Today , I'll talk about going online. The Internet can make our lives interesting and enjoyable. Many of us like going online very much because we can learn how to use the computer and get more information from the Internet. We can learn English . We can read some good newspapers and magazines. It can make us clever in playing computer games. I can send e-mails to our friends quickly. It can help us keep in touch with people from all over the world. But some students spend too much time in playing computer games and some stay in the net bars all day and all night. As a result, they do worse and worse in their lessons and they don't study well any more. I think we mustn't go online when it is time for us to study. We can do it in summer or winter holidays.


All of us want to be healthy. First밃we should get enough sleep during the night. We can go to bed early and get up early. Staying up late is bad for our health. Second, we must have the right kinds of food. We should eat more fruit and vegetables and less meat. We should drink a lot of water. We should have healthy eating habits. Third, we should do more exercise to build up our bodies. Finally, we should wash hands before meals and brush our teeth twice a day. If we don't feel well, we should go to see the doctor at once.


English is one of my best subjects and I started learning English when I was ten years old. But at the very beginning, listening seemed a little difficult for me. So I have been doing a lot of listening practice, such as listening to tapes, watching English TV programs. And I found it really helped a lot. In fact, there are some more helpful ways to learn English well. For example, I enjoy singing English songs and I want to join an English club or find a pen pal from English-speaking countries. I believe that nothing is impossible if you put your heart into it.

Study brings me happiness
  Why do we come to school? Different people may have different answers. Some people say that they come to school to study just because they dream of a better job, a better future. But in my viewpoint, study brings me happiness. It is said that everyone who is interested in studying may find pleasure in reading. Exactly!

The best TV programme I've ever watched
 The best TV programme I've ever watched is몼human and nature몽. The programme is broadcasted on CCTV1 every week. It is about animals목plants and the relationship between human and nature. From this TV programme , I've got to know that nature is full of mysteries. I also realize that humans are responsible for the bad environment. If we don't care about nature, we will pay much more. The TV programme brings me much knowledge. I love it very much. 





How to use computers correctly
Dear friends,
   How time flies! I'm very glad here to tell you something about computers. Computers have both advantages and disadvantages. We can search the Internet for information, listen to music, chat with our friends, play computer games .. . But some students have problems. They spend too much time on the computers. This is not good for their eyes and does harm to their studies as well. Even worse, some students may watch bad web sites. So it is necessary for us to use computer correctly. Here is some advice: firstly, homework first and surf the Internet regularly. Secondly, don't give your personal information to a stranger. Thirdly, do things that are good to your studies. 
  I wish you a colorful school life!  



Water shortage
   As we all know, water is very important in our life. We can't imagine life without water. But now, lots of rivers and lakes are seriously polluted. Clean water is less and less. The problem of water shortage is becoming more and more serious. 
  We should take some actions to solve this problem. First, government should make laws to prevent factories from pouring waste water into rivers or lakes. Second, we should take a shower instead of taking a bath. Finally, we shouldn't leave the tap running when we are brushing our teeth. If we don't save water, the last drop of water will be a tear-drop of us. 



I want to be an environment protector
   Nowadays the problems of environment are becoming more and more serious. Factories pour dirty water (chemical waste) into rivers or lakes. Cars give off waste gas and the air is unhealthy for us to breathe. More and more trees are cut down. The earth is our only home and we have the duty to take care of it. So I want to be an environment protector. First, I will tell the people around me to protect environment. Second, I몵d like to plant more trees with my friends. Finally, I will shop with a reusable bag instead of a plastic bag. I believe if every one of us do something to protect our environment, our world will be greener and more beautiful몪


6.Environment around us
  The environment is very important to us. We need the fresh air, the clean water and so on. There used to be many trees around us, the air was fresh and the river was clean. But now, people cut down too many trees and the environment around us becomes worse and worse. So as a students, we should try to protect our environment. First of all, we should plant as many trees as possible. Second, we should ride bikes or walk to school instead of taking buses or cars. Third, we shouldn몶t use plastic bags. In a word, if everyone knows the importance of environment protection, we몶ll have a green world./


My view on computer
  With the development of science and technology, computers are playing more and more important roles in our daily life. They can  do most of the things people can do. By using computers, we can gain huge amount of knowledge and information, especially, computers have made the communication with our friends and relatives more convenient and easier. But some students are so keen on playing games online that they even don몶t want to go to school. I don't think it is right. In my opinion, we should make good use ot computers.


The Spring Festival
As we all kown,the Spring Festival is the most important festival in China. On the New Year몶s Eve, families always get together and have a big dinner. Many people like to set off  firecracker. People also eat dumping--- a kind of traditional Chinese food. Especially, children like the festival very much because they can nit only have delicious food, wear new clothes but also receive red packets from their parents or their elders. It is said that the money in the red 



As is vividly portrayed in the picture, people in big cities are suffering from haze, forcing them to guard against haze. 
In contemporary society, haze has become one of the serious pollutants in China, especially in highly-developed cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. On condition that we are in haze for a long time, we will not only feel frustrated but also suffer from a variety of diseases. It sounds unbelievable, but it happens around us whenever and wherever. Both the government and the citizens should seek solutions to handle this problem. Initially, the government should spend more money promoting the development of anti-pollution technology. Moreover, more effective environmental policies ought to be made and carried out. In addition, the public awareness of safeguarding the environment is supposed to be raised. To illustrate, we can choose public transportations and bicycles instead of private cars. 
To sum up, only in these ways can we relieve environmental pollution like haze to better our life. 


Currently, with the rapid growth in economy of Shanghai, private cars have been increasingly popular with people. Meanwhile, the roads are becoming more crowded as a result of the heavy traffic. To solve the problem, I am going to put forward several feasible ideas below. 
Firstly, taking a taxi should be advocated. It is true that going anywhere in a private car is comfortable and convenient. However, the cost of a car includes petrol fees, parking fees, insurance fees and other costs, which results in a big sum of money paid for cars while there is no need for it by taking a taxi. What몶s more, more roads can be built to relieve traffic. And at the same time, buses should have their own special routes so that more people will take the public buses instead of travelling by private cars and bicycles. Besides, taking underground is another better way to go out, especially in rush hours as well as in a busy street. In this way, you will never be worried about the traffic jam. Instead, you will get relieved from a great amount of cost and a tense life.
To sum up, the problem of traffic jam is an urgent one concerning safety and convenience. It몶s our duty to take action to solve it. 


A Classmate Who Influences Me Most
    As the old saying goes, 몷A life without a friend is a life without a sun.몸 During my high school life, Han Meimei is my best friend who has great influence on me. 
    Han Meimei is my classmate in high school. She is a little plump and has a round face. You can always find a nice smile on her face, which reflects her amiable and pleasant character. Our friendship attributes to her help to me in many ways.
    In terms of study, she is good at English, while English is not my cup of tea. When I am confused about teacher몶s explanation of texts, she always interprets them to me in a simple and clear way. Besides, she also teaches me a few language learning tips which arouse my learning interest.
모모In addition, in our free time, she helps me a lot as well. My home is far from our school so I am a boarder. Sometimes I feel homesick. However, I always have Han Meimei on my side, whose accompanying comforts me a lot.
A father is a treasure, a brother is a comfort, but a friend is both. I feel so lucky that I have such a good friend who has good influence on me both in my study and leisure life.



packets will bring children good luck. Chinese people have a good time during the festival.

    Han Meimei is my classmate in high school. She is a little plump and has a round face. You can always find a nice smile on her face, which reflects her amiable and pleasant character. Our friendship attributes to her help to me in many ways.
    In terms of study, she is good at English, while English is not my cup of tea. When I am confused about teacher몶s explanation of texts, she always interprets them to me in a simple and clear way. Besides, she also teaches me a few language learning tips which arouse my learning interest.
모모In addition, in our free time, she helps me a lot as well. My home is far from our school so I am a boarder. Sometimes I feel homesick. However, I always have Han Meimei on my side, whose accompanying comforts me a lot.
A father is a treasure, a brother is a comfort, but a friend is both. I feel so lucky that I have such a good friend who has good influence on me both in my study and leisure life.



packets will bring children good luck. Chinese people have a good time during the festival.
Nowadays mobile phones are becoming more and more popular among the middle school students. In my opinion, we can bring mobile phones to school.
As we know, the 21st century is a modern age and full of information. A mobile phone is one of the quickest tools for us to exchange information. The mobile phone is a fashionable and useful invention, so we ought to make the best use of it. Suppose there's a sudden accident, it is more convenient for us to dial for help immediately. There're also some games in the mobile phone. We can relax ourselves by playing them when we're tired of our studies. In my opinion, it's not wrong to follow the fashion, but the most important thing is how to use the mobile phone in a right way.


Today , I'll talk about going online. The Internet can make our lives interesting and enjoyable. Many of us like going online very much because we can learn how to use the computer and get more information from the Internet. We can learn English . We can read some good newspapers and magazines. It can make us clever in playing computer games. I can send e-mails to our friends quickly. It can help us keep in touch with people from all over the world. But some students spend too much time in playing computer games and some stay in the net bars all day and all night. As a result, they do worse and worse in their lessons and they don't study well any more. I think we mustn't go online when it is time for us to study. We can do it in summer or winter holidays.


All of us want to be healthy. First밃we should get enough sleep during the night. We can go to bed early and get up early. Staying up late is bad for our health. Second, we must have the right kinds of food. We should eat more fruit and vegetables and less meat. We should drink a lot of water. We should have healthy eating habits. Third, we should do more exercise to build up our bodies. Finally, we should wash hands before meals and brush our teeth twice a day. If we don't feel well, we should go to see the doctor at once.


English is one of my best subjects and I started learning English when I was ten years old. But at the very beginning, listening seemed a little difficult for me. So I have been doing a lot of listening practice, such as listening to tapes, watching English TV programs. And I found it really helped a lot. In fact, there are some more helpful ways to learn English well. For example, I enjoy singing English songs and I want to join an English club or find a pen pal from English-speaking countries. I believe that nothing is impossible if you put your heart into it.

Study brings me happiness
  Why do we come to school? Different people may have different answers. Some people say that they come to school to study just because they dream of a better job, a better future. But in my viewpoint, study brings me happiness. It is said that everyone who is interested in studying may find pleasure in reading. Exactly!

The best TV programme I've ever watched
 The best TV programme I've ever watched is몼human and nature몽. The programme is broadcasted on CCTV1 every week. It is about animals목plants and the relationship between human and nature. From this TV programme , I've got to know that nature is full of mysteries. I also realize that humans are responsible for the bad environment. If we don't care about nature, we will pay much more. The TV programme brings me much knowledge. I love it very much.





How to use computers correctly
Dear friends,
   How time flies! I'm very glad here to tell you something about computers. Computers have both advantages and disadvantages. We can search the Internet for information, listen to music, chat with our friends, play computer games .. . But some students have problems. They spend too much time on the computers. This is not good for their eyes and does harm to their studies as well. Even worse, some students may watch bad web sites. So it is necessary for us to use computer correctly. Here is some advice: firstly, homework first and surf the Internet regularly. Secondly, don't give your personal information to a stranger. Thirdly, do things that are good to your studies.
  I wish you a colorful school life!



Water shortage
   As we all know, water is very important in our life. We can't imagine life without water. But now, lots of rivers and lakes are seriously polluted. Clean water is less and less. The problem of water shortage is becoming more and more serious.
  We should take some actions to solve this problem. First, government should make laws to prevent factories from pouring waste water into rivers or lakes. Second, we should take a shower instead of taking a bath. Finally, we shouldn't leave the tap running when we are brushing our teeth. If we don't save water, the last drop of water will be a tear-drop of us.



I want to be an environment protector
   Nowadays the problems of environment are becoming more and more serious. Factories pour dirty water (chemical waste) into rivers or lakes. Cars give off waste gas and the air is unhealthy for us to breathe. More and more trees are cut down. The earth is our only home and we have the duty to take care of it. So I want to be an environment protector. First, I will tell the people around me to protect environment. Second, I몵d like to plant more trees with my friends. Finally, I will shop with a reusable bag instead of a plastic bag. I believe if every one of us do something to protect our environment, our world will be greener and more beautiful몪


6.Environment around us
  The environment is very important to us. We need the fresh air, the clean water and so on. There used to be many trees around us, the air was fresh and the river was clean. But now, people cut down too many trees and the environment around us becomes worse and worse. So as a students, we should try to protect our environment. First of all, we should plant as many trees as possible. Second, we should ride bikes or walk to school instead of taking buses or cars. Third, we shouldn몶t use plastic bags. In a word, if everyone knows the importance of environment protection, we몶ll have a green world./


My view on computer
  With the development of science and technology, computers are playing more and more important roles in our daily life. They can  do most of the things people can do. By using computers, we can gain huge amount of knowledge and information, especially, computers have made the communication with our friends and relatives more convenient and easier. But some students are so keen on playing games online that they even don몶t want to go to school. I don't think it is right. In my opinion, we should make good use ot computers.


The Spring Festival
As we all kown,the Spring Festival is the most important festival in China. On the New Year몶s Eve, families always get together and have a big dinner. Many people like to set off  firecracker. People also eat dumping--- a kind of traditional Chinese food. Especially, children like the festival very much because they can nit only have delicious food, wear new clothes but also receive red packets from their parents or their elders. It is said that the money in the red



As is vividly portrayed in the picture, people in big cities are suffering from haze, forcing them to guard against haze.
In contemporary society, haze has become one of the serious pollutants in China, especially in highly-developed cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. On condition that we are in haze for a long time, we will not only feel frustrated but also suffer from a variety of diseases. It sounds unbelievable, but it happens around us whenever and wherever. Both the government and the citizens should seek solutions to handle this problem. Initially, the government should spend more money promoting the development of anti-pollution technology. Moreover, more effective environmental policies ought to be made and carried out. In addition, the public awareness of safeguarding the environment is supposed to be raised. To illustrate, we can choose public transportations and bicycles instead of private cars.
To sum up, only in these ways can we relieve environmental pollution like haze to better our life.


Currently, with the rapid growth in economy of Shanghai, private cars have been increasingly popular with people. Meanwhile, the roads are becoming more crowded as a result of the heavy traffic. To solve the problem, I am going to put forward several feasible ideas below.
Firstly, taking a taxi should be advocated. It is true that going anywhere in a private car is comfortable and convenient. However, the cost of a car includes petrol fees, parking fees, insurance fees and other costs, which results in a big sum of money paid for cars while there is no need for it by taking a taxi. What몶s more, more roads can be built to relieve traffic. And at the same time, buses should have their own special routes so that more people will take the public buses instead of travelling by private cars and bicycles. Besides, taking underground is another better way to go out, especially in rush hours as well as in a busy street. In this way, you will never be worried about the traffic jam. Instead, you will get relieved from a great amount of cost and a tense life.
To sum up, the problem of traffic jam is an urgent one concerning safety and convenience. It몶s our duty to take action to solve it.

Currently, with the rapid growth in economy of Shanghai, private cars have been increasingly popular with people. Meanwhile, the roads are becoming more crowded as a result of the heavy traffic. To solve the problem, I am going to put forward several feasible ideas below.
Firstly, taking a taxi should be advocated. It is true that going anywhere in a private car is comfortable and convenient. However, the cost of a car includes petrol fees, parking fees, insurance fees and other costs, which results in a big sum of money paid for cars while there is no need for it by taking a taxi. What몶s more, more roads can be built to relieve traffic. And at the same time, buses should have their own special routes so that more people will take the public buses instead of travelling by private cars and bicycles. Besides, taking underground is another better way to go out, especially in rush hours as well as in a busy street. In this way, you will never be worried about the traffic jam. Instead, you will get relieved from a great amount of cost and a tense life.
To sum up, the problem of traffic jam is an urgent one concerning safety and convenience. It몶s our duty to take action to solve it.


A Classmate Who Influences Me Most
    As the old saying goes, 몷A life without a friend is a life without a sun.몸 During my high school life, Han Meimei is my best friend who has great influence on me.
    Han Meimei is my classmate in high school. She is a little plump and has a round face. You can always find a nice smile on her face, which reflects her amiable and pleasant character. Our friendship attributes to her help to me in many ways.
    In terms of study, she is good at English, while English is not my cup of tea. When I am confused about teacher몶s explanation of texts, she always interprets them to me in a simple and clear way. Besides, she also teaches me a few language learning tips which arouse my learning interest.
모모In addition, in our free time, she helps me a lot as well. My home is far from our school so I am a boarder. Sometimes I feel homesick. However, I always have Han Meimei on my side, whose accompanying comforts me a lot.
A father is a treasure, a brother is a comfort, but a friend is both. I feel so lucky that I have such a good friend who has good influence on me both in my study and leisure life.



packets will bring children good luck. Chinese people have a good time during the festival.
Nowadays mobile phones are becoming more and more popular among the middle school students. In my opinion, we can bring mobile phones to school.
As we know, the 21st century is a modern age and full of information. A mobile phone is one of the quickest tools for us to exchange information. The mobile phone is a fashionable and useful invention, so we ought to make the best use of it. Suppose there's a sudden accident, it is more convenient for us to dial for help immediately. There're also some games in the mobile phone. We can relax ourselves by playing them when we're tired of our studies. In my opinion, it's not wrong to follow the fashion, but the most important thing is how to use the mobile phone in a right way.


Today , I'll talk about going online. The Internet can make our lives interesting and enjoyable. Many of us like going online very much because we can learn how to use the computer and get more information from the Internet. We can learn English . We can read some good newspapers and magazines. It can make us clever in playing computer games. I can send e-mails to our friends quickly. It can help us keep in touch with people from all over the world. But some students spend too much time in playing computer games and some stay in the net bars all day and all night. As a result, they do worse and worse in their lessons and they don't study well any more. I think we mustn't go online when it is time for us to study. We can do it in summer or winter holidays.


All of us want to be healthy. First밃we should get enough sleep during the night. We can go to bed early and get up early. Staying up late is bad for our health. Second, we must have the right kinds of food. We should eat more fruit and vegetables and less meat. We should drink a lot of water. We should have healthy eating habits. Third, we should do more exercise to build up our bodies. Finally, we should wash hands before meals and brush our teeth twice a day. If we don't feel well, we should go to see the doctor at once.


English is one of my best subjects and I started learning English when I was ten years old. But at the very beginning, listening seemed a little difficult for me. So I have been doing a lot of listening practice, such as listening to tapes, watching English TV programs. And I found it really helped a lot. In fact, there are some more helpful ways to learn English well. For example, I enjoy singing English songs and I want to join an English club or find a pen pal from English-speaking countries. I believe that nothing is impossible if you put your heart into it.

Study brings me happiness
  Why do we come to school? Different people may have different answers. Some people say that they come to school to study just because they dream of a better job, a better future.

How to use computers correctly
Dear friends,
   How time flies! I'm very glad here to tell you something about computers. Computers have both advantages and disadvantages. We can search the Internet for information, listen to music, chat with our friends, play computer games .. . But some students have problems. They spend too much time on the computers. This is not good for their eyes and does harm to their studies as well. Even worse, some students may watch bad web sites. So it is necessary for us to use computer correctly. Here is some advice: firstly, homework first and surf the Internet regularly. Secondly, don't give your personal information to a stranger. Thirdly, do things that are good to your studies.
  I wish you a colorful school life!



Water shortage
   As we all know, water is very important in our life. We can't imagine life without water. But now, lots of rivers and lakes are seriously polluted. Clean water is less and less. The problem of water shortage is becoming more and more serious.
  We should take some actions to solve this problem. First, government should make laws to prevent factories from pouring waste water into rivers or lakes. Second, we should take a shower instead of taking a bath. Finally, we shouldn't leave the tap running when we are brushing our teeth. If we don't save water, the last drop of water will be a tear-drop of us.



I want to be an environment protector
   Nowadays the problems of environment are becoming more and more serious. Factories pour dirty water (chemical waste) into rivers or lakes. Cars give off waste gas and the air is unhealthy for us to breathe. More and more trees are cut down. The earth is our only home and we have the duty to take care of it. So I want to be an environment protector. First, I will tell the people around me to protect environment. Second, I몵d like to plant more trees with my friends. Finally, I will shop with a reusable bag instead of a plastic bag. I believe if every one of us do something to protect our environment, our world will be greener and more beautiful몪


6.Environment around us
  The environment is very important to us. We need the fresh air, the clean water and so on. There used to be many trees around us, the air was fresh and the river was clean. But now, people cut down too many trees and the environment around us becomes worse and worse. So as a students, we should try to protect our environment. First of all, we should plant as many trees as possible. Second, we should ride bikes or walk to school instead of taking buses or cars. Third, we shouldn몶t use plastic bags. In a word, if everyone knows the importance of environment protection, we몶ll have a green world./


My view on computer
  With the development of science and technology, computers are playing more and more important roles in our daily life. They can  do most of the things people can do. By using computers, we can gain huge amount of knowledge and information, especially, computers have made the communication with our friends and relatives more convenient and easier. But some students are so keen on playing games online that they even don몶t want to go to school. I don't think it is right. In my opinion, we should make good use ot computers.


The Spring Festival
As we all kown,the Spring Festival is the most important festival in China. On the New Year몶s Eve, families always get together and have a big dinner. Many people like to set off  firecracker.

It is said that the money in the red



As is vividly portrayed in the picture, people in big cities are suffering from haze, forcing them to guard against haze.
In contemporary society, haze has become one of the serious pollutants in China, especially in highly-developed cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. On condition that we are in haze for a long time, we will not only feel frustrated but also suffer from a variety of diseases. It sounds unbelievable, but it happens around us whenever and wherever. Both the government and the citizens should seek solutions to handle this problem. Initially, the government should spend more money promoting the development of anti-pollution technology. Moreover, more effective environmental policies ought to be made and carried out. In addition, the public awareness of safeguarding the environment is supposed to be raised. To illustrate, we can choose public transportations and bicycles instead of private cars.
To sum up, only in these ways can we relieve environmental pollution like haze to better our life.

As we all kown,the Spring Festival is the most important festival in China. On the New Year몶s Eve, families always get together and have a big dinner. Many people like to set off  firecracker. People also eat dumping--- a kind of traditional Chinese food. Especially, children like the festival very much because they can nit only have delicious food, wear new clothes but also receive red packets from their parents or their elders. It is said that the money in the red



As is vividly portrayed in the picture, people in big cities are suffering from haze, forcing them to guard against haze.
In contemporary society, haze has become one of the serious pollutants in China, especially in highly-developed cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. On condition that we are in haze for a long time, we will not only feel frustrated but also suffer from a variety of diseases. It sounds unbelievable, but it happens around us whenever and wherever. Both the government and the citizens should seek solutions to handle this problem. Initially, the government should spend more money promoting the development of anti-pollution technology. Moreover, more effective environmental policies ought to be made and carried out. In addition, the public awareness of safeguarding the environment is supposed to be raised. To illustrate, we can choose public transportations and bicycles instead of private cars.
To sum up, only in these ways can we relieve environmental pollution like haze to better our life.


Currently, with the rapid growth in economy of Shanghai, private cars have been increasingly popular with people. Meanwhile, the roads are becoming more crowded as a result of the heavy traffic. To solve the problem, I am going to put forward several feasible ideas below.
Firstly, taking a taxi should be advocated. It is true that going anywhere in a private car is comfortable and convenient. However, the cost of a car includes petrol fees, parking fees, insurance fees and other costs, which results in a big sum of money paid for cars while there is no need for it by taking a taxi. What몶s more, more roads can be built to relieve traffic. And at the same time, buses should have their own special routes so that more people will take the public buses instead of travelling by private cars and bicycles. Besides, taking underground is another better way to go out, especially in rush hours as well as in a busy street. In this way, you will never be worried about the traffic jam. Instead, you will get relieved from a great amount of cost and a tense life.
To sum up, the problem of traffic jam is an urgent one concerning safety and convenience. It몶s our duty to take action to solve it.


A Classmate Who Influences Me Most
    As the old saying goes, 몷A life without a friend is a life without a sun.몸 During my high school life, Han Meimei is my best friend who has great influence on me.
    Han Meimei is my classmate in high school. She is a little plump and has a round face. You can always find a nice smile on her face, which reflects her amiable and pleasant character. Our friendship attributes to her help to me in many ways.
    In terms of study, she is good at English, while English is not my cup of tea. When I am confused about teacher몶s explanation of texts, she always interprets them to me in a simple and clear way. Besides, she also teaches me a few language learning tips which arouse my learning interest.
모모In addition, in our free time, she helps me a lot as well. My home is far from our school so I am a boarder. Sometimes I feel homesick. However, I always have Han Meimei on my side, whose accompanying comforts me a lot.
A father is a treasure, a brother is a comfort, but a friend is both. I feel so lucky that I have such a good friend who has good influence on me both in my study and leisure life.



packets will bring children good luck. Chinese people have a good time during the festival.
Nowadays mobile phones are becoming more and more popular among the middle school students. In my opinion, we can bring mobile phones to school.
As we know, the 21st century is a modern age and full of information. A mobile phone is one of the quickest tools for us to exchange information. The mobile phone is a fashionable and useful invention, so we ought to make the best use of it. Suppose there's a sudden accident, it is more convenient for us to dial for help immediately. There're also some games in the mobile phone. We can relax ourselves by playing them when we're tired of our studies. In my opinion, it's not wrong to follow the fashion, but the most important thing is how to use the mobile phone in a right way.


Today , I'll talk about going online. The Internet can make our lives interesting and enjoyable. Many of us like going online very much because we can learn how to use the computer and get more information from the Internet. We can learn English . We can read some good newspapers and magazines. It can make us clever in playing computer games. I can send e-mails to our friends quickly. It can help us keep in touch with people from all over the world. But some students spend too much time in playing computer games and some stay in the net bars all day and all night. As a result, they do worse and worse in their lessons and they don't study well any more. I think we mustn't go online when it is time for us to study. We can do it in summer or winter holidays.


All of us want to be healthy. First밃we should get enough sleep during the night. We can go to bed early and get up early. Staying up late is bad for our health. Second, we must have the right kinds of food. We should eat more fruit and vegetables and less meat. We should drink a lot of water. We should have healthy eating habits. Third, we should do more exercise to build up our bodies. Finally, we should wash hands before meals and brush our teeth twice a day. If we don't feel well, we should go to see the doctor at once.


English is one of my best subjects and I started learning English when I was ten years old. But at the very beginning, listening seemed a little difficult for me. So I have been doing a lot of listening practice, such as listening to tapes, watching English TV programs. And I found it really helped a lot. In fact, there are some more helpful ways to learn English well. For example, I enjoy singing English songs and I want to join an English club or find a pen pal from English-speaking countries. I believe that nothing is impossible if you put your heart into it.

Study brings me happiness
  Why do we come to school? Different people may have different answers. Some people say that they come to school to study just because they dream of a better job, a better future. But in my viewpoint, study brings me happiness. It is said that everyone who is interested in studying may find pleasure in reading. Exactly! Study can not only enrich my knowledge and broaden my mind, but bring me lots of fun as well. What's more, study always teaches me how to be honest, confident and knowledgeable.

The best TV programme I've ever watched
 The best TV programme I've ever watched is몼human and nature몽. The programme is broadcasted on CCTV1 every week. It is about animals목plants and the relationship between human and nature.

The TV programme brings me much knowledge. I love it very much.





How to use computers correctly
Dear friends,
   How time flies! I'm very glad here to tell you something about computers. Computers have both advantages and disadvantages. We can search the Internet for information, listen to music, chat with our friends, play computer games .. . But some students have problems. They spend too much time on the computers. This is not good for their eyes and does harm to their studies as well. Even worse, some students may watch bad web sites. So it is necessary for us to use computer correctly. Here is some advice: firstly, homework first and surf the Internet regularly. Secondly, don't give your personal information to a stranger. Thirdly, do things that are good to your studies.
  I wish you a colorful school life!



Water shortage
   As we all know, water is very important in our life. We can't imagine life without water. But now, lots of rivers and lakes are seriously polluted. Clean water is less and less. The problem of water shortage is becoming more and more serious.
  We should take some actions to solve this problem. First, government should make laws to prevent factories from pouring waste water into rivers or lakes. Second, we should take a shower instead of taking a bath. Finally, we shouldn't leave the tap running when we are brushing our teeth. If we don't save water, the last drop of water will be a tear-drop of us.



I want to be an environment protector
   Nowadays the problems of environment are becoming more and more serious. Factories pour dirty water (chemical waste) into rivers or lakes. Cars give off waste gas and the air is unhealthy for us to breathe. More and more trees are cut down. The earth is our only home and we have the duty to take care of it. So I want to be an environment protector. First, I will tell the people around me to protect environment. Second, I몵d like to plant more trees with my friends. Finally, I will shop with a reusable bag instead of a plastic bag. I believe if every one of us do something to protect our environment, our world will be greener and more beautiful몪


6.Environment around us
  The environment is very important to us. We need the fresh air, the clean water and so on. There used to be many trees around us, the air was fresh and the river was clean. But now, people cut down too many trees and the environment around us becomes worse and worse. So as a students, we should try to protect our environment. First of all, we should plant as many trees as possible. Second, we should ride bikes or walk to school instead of taking buses or cars. Third, we shouldn몶t use plastic bags. In a word, if everyone knows the importance of environment protection, we몶ll have a green world./


My view on computer
  With the development of science and technology, computers are playing more and more important roles in our daily life. They can  do most of the things people can do. By using computers, we can gain huge amount of knowledge and information, especially, computers have made the communication with our friends and relatives more convenient and easier. But some students are so keen on playing games online that they even don몶t want to go to school. I don't think it is right. In my opinion, we should make good use ot computers.
