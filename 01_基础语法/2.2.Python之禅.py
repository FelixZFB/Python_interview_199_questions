# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
#
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

# 美比丑好，明比涩强。
# 简胜于繁，繁强于难。
# 平言莫绕，宜疏莫密。
# 行文如水，易懂为王。
# 勿提特例，皆循此规。
# 实虽胜纯，识错必究。
# 若需留证，亦要言明。
# 不明其理，追根问底。
# 必有一法，可解谜题。
# 汝非龟叔，求之故难。
# 立足当下，行必有方。
# 行难言喻，所思欠妥。
# 行易言表，所思可嘉。
# 名正易识，善莫大焉！
