Nowadays mobile phones are becoming more and more popular among the middle school students. In my opinion, we can bring mobile phones to school.
As we know, the 21st century is a modern age and full of information. A mobile phone is one of the quickest tools for us to exchange information. The mobile phone is a fashionable and useful invention, so we ought to make the best use of it. Suppose there's a sudden accident, it is more convenient for us to dial for help immediately. There're also some games in the mobile phone. We can relax ourselves by playing them when we're tired of our studies. In my opinion, it's not wrong to follow the fashion, but the most important thing is how to use the mobile phone in a right way.


Today , I'll talk about going online. The Internet can make our lives interesting and enjoyable. Many of us like going online very much because we can learn how to use the computer and get more information from the Internet. We can learn English . We can read some good newspapers and magazines. It can make us clever in playing computer games. I can send e-mails to our friends quickly. It can help us keep in touch with people from all over the world. But some students spend too much time in playing computer games and some stay in the net bars all day and all night. As a result, they do worse and worse in their lessons and they don't study well any more. I think we mustn't go online when it is time for us to study. We can do it in summer or winter holidays.
